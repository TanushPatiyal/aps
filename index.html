       <b>I think that words sums up all that you would feel. My first speech competition was in 4th and I had memorized what I had to say and I remember where I exactly stood it was first. Though what I do remember is how I could not make out if the microphone was receiving my voice properly. I did not know if I was talking clearly. I thought I was talking too fast (as was confirmed by my political science teacher later on). What I do remember is how after I finished and said my winding up argument, my voice continued to stay in a slightly higher pitch (out of nervousness I guess) but at the same time, I wanted to go back and do a better job. I honestly think that's what got me started off.Ever since then be it school or collegiate debates I have always put my name forward. I finished in the top three in most in few I didn't but ever since then each time I have gone up and addressed a different gathering of faces I have always primarily faced that same emotion that hit me that very first time.</b>

        The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descnptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the night nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen has been provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

      1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
      <br><br>
      2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It seves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
      <br><br>
      3. Productivity/Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time

consuming, laborious, and expensive affair, it takes time to process paper sheets and time cards,

create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious

administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of

employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort

saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to

increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility/Insights, Hassle Free
